# NETWORK CORE
-- multiple packet lost for same requestid => timestamp => one timer per request instead of per type 
   check packet on packetid so multiple receive of same packet will not be duplicated on server or client
-- packet memory free
-- disconnect connexion on too much retries for the server
-- implement more checks on setData fields or force use of methods with all fields so there are set in the right way for sure
